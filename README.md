I made a fall-themed website with fall-themed minigames.
First, there's a game where the player can click leaves to "catch" them, and increase their score by 1 for each.
Second, there's a game where the player can click the "SHOOT!" button to launch an acorn at the target, where it might hit the bullseye (increases score by 1-5 depending).
Third, there's a game where the player can bet on which turkey will win the race, and if right, their score will increase by 10, if not, decrease by 10.
There's also a tab to see stats, such as number of attempts and number of points earned for each minigame.
Lastly, if the player clicks the spinning maple leaf next to their score, it will trigger a Canada jumpscare, flag and anthem included.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
